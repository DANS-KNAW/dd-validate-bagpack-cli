The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-validate-bagpack-cli and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-validate-bagpack-cli . For installation on systems that do no support RPM and/or systemd: Build the tarball (see next section). Extract it to some location on your system, for example /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-validate-bagpack-cli . Start the service with the following command /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-validate-bagpack-cli/bin/dd-validate-bagpack-cli server /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-validate-bagpack-cli/cfg/config.yml BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 11 or higher Maven 3.3.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/dd-validate-bagpack-cli.git cd dd-validate-bagpack-cli mvn clean install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated.
